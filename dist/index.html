I used to work in advertising as an art director but since 2006 I have been working as a photographer.\n\nLARGE FORMAT PHOTOGRAPHY\nAll the pictures on this site are made with a large format film-based camera from the sixties. The large negatives (4x5\") gives the images a richness in detail, depth, colour and texture that you are not able to achive with digital cameras. Large format photography demands a degree of technical preparation and concentration that makes the whole experience a bit different. It keeps me on my toes and makes me perform better.\n\nADVERTISING\nAs an art director I was sometimes disappointed when the finished pictured differed a lot from the original idea. This can easily happen because a photographer has to make a lot more choices than the creatives. An advertising idea is often a very simplified version of the real world. I find that quite generic motifs, people and places that are clean and classic versions of themselves communicate advertising ideas well. Some parks are more parks than others, if you know what I mean. I spend a lot of time trying to find the people and the places that match the original idea and the level of realism/surrealism that the idea demands. In the section People and places I have tried to give a few examples.\n"}}]</textarea>
